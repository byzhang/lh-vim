= Features =

lh-refactor is a generic refactoring plugin.

So far it supports the following refactorings:
  * Extract Function,
  * Extract Variable,
  * Extract Type,
and the following languages: C, C++, Java, Pascal, VimL.

The list of languages supported can be extended (however some refactoring work in the plugin is required to simplify that part)

The complete documentation can be browsed [http://code.google.com/p/lh-vim/source/browse/refactor/trunk/doc/refactor.txt in the subversion repository]
