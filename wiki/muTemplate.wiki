#summary mu-template: template-files expander
#labels Featured

== Introduction ==

µTemplate is a template-files loader for Vim. Once loaded, templates are interpreted and expanded according to a flexible syntax.

== Features ==
  * Templates can be expanded:
    * automatically when opening a new buffer (can be deactivated),
    * explicitly through menus or the command line,
    * from the INSERT-mode in a snippet-like fashion ;
  * All snippets are defined in their own template-files ;
  * The template-files can be overriden ;
  * Filetype specific snippets can be defined for the INSERT-mode (they can be inherited, e.g. C snippets can be used from C++, Java, _etc._);
  * Computed VimL expressions can be inserted ;
  * VimL instructions can be executed during the expansion ;
  * Template-files can include other template-files in a function-like manner ;
  * Fully integrated with my [lhBrackets placeholders-system] ;
  * Supports reindentation (if desired) ; 
  * Works well with vim folding ;
  * I18n friendly
